# Maya-mini-tools
Maya mini tools that solve simple problems that I have encountered (mainly task automatization for rigging)

01: Attribute connector tool 
Description: tool that connects an attribute to another attribute of the selected object/s so you can avoid connecting them manually.

02: Base rig Outliner structure creator 
Description: tool that automatically generates the basic rig structure in the Outliner based on your asset's name and colorizes each group.
